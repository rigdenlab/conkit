    Command line object for bbcontacts [#]_ contact filtering application

    https://github.com/soedinglab/bbcontacts

    The bbcontacts program is a Python program predicting residue-level
    contacts between beta-strands by detecting patterns in matrices of
    predicted couplings. bbcontacts can make use of a secondary structure
    assignment or a secondary structure prediction.

    .. [#] Andreani J., SÃ¶ding J. (2015). bbcontacts: prediction of beta-strand
       pairing from direct coupling patterns. Bioinformatics 31(11), 1729-1737.


    Examples
    --------
    To filter a contact map using a Multiple Sequence Alignment in
    CCMpred format, use:

    >>> from conkit.applications import BbcontactsCommandline
    >>> bbcontacts_cline = BbcontactsCommandline(
    ...     matfile='test.mat', diversity_score=0.482, prefix='test'
    ... )
    >>> print(bbcontacts_cline)
    bbcontacts

    You would typically run the command line with :func:`bbcontacts_cline` or via
    the :mod:`~subprocess` module.

    Note
    ----
    Installation instructions are available via the `GitHub repository
    <https://github.com/soedinglab/bbcontacts>`_.
