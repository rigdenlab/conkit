    CD-HIT is a very widely used program for clustering and comparing
    protein or nucleotide sequences. CD-HIT was originally developed
    by Dr. Weizhong Li at Dr. Adam Godzik's Lab at the Burnham Institute
    (now Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute).

    CD-HIT is very fast and can handle extremely large databases. CD-HIT
    helps to significantly reduce the computational and manual efforts in
    many sequence analysis tasks and aids in understanding the data
    structure and correct the bias within a dataset.

    .. [#] Li W, Jaroszewski L, Godzik A(2001). Clustering of highly homologous sequences
       to reduce thesize of large protein database. Bioinformatics 17, 282-283.

       speeds up clustering of large protein databases. Bioinformatics 18, 77-82.


    Examples
    --------
    >>> from conkit.applications import CdhitCommandline
    >>> cdhit_cline = CdhitCommandline()
    >>> print(cdhit_cline)

    You would typically run the command line with :func:`cdhit_cline` or via
    the :mod:`~subprocess` module.
