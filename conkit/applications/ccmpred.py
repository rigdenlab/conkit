    Command line object for CCMpred [#]_ contact prediction application

    https://github.com/soedinglab/CCMpred

    The CCMpred program is a very fast pseudo-likelihood maximisation
    implementation of covariance detection in a Multiple Sequence
    Alignment. This wrapper allows for easy-to-use Python implementation.

    .. [#] Seemayer S, Gruber M, SÃ¶ding J (2014). CCMpred--fast and precise
       prediction of protein residue-residue contacts from correlated mutations.
       Bioinformatics 30(21), 3128-3130.

    Examples
    --------
    To predict a contact map using a Multiple Sequence Alignment in
    JONES format, use:

    >>> from conkit.applications import CCMpredCommandline
    >>> ccmpred_cline = CCMpredCommandline(
    ...    alnfile="test.aln", matfile="output.mat"
    ... )
    >>> print(ccmpred_cline)
    ccmpred test.aln output.mat

    You would typically run the command line with :func:`ccmpred_cline` or via
    the :mod:`~subprocess` module.
