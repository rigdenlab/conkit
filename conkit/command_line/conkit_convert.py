"""This script provides direct access to ConKit's conversion algorithms.

This script can convert either contact prediction files or sequence files.
In case of the latter, a file with a single or multiple sequences can be
converted.

!!! IMPORTANT
=============
Do not attempt to mix formats, i.e. convert from a contact file format
to a sequence file format.
