**NEW: Now ConKit is also compatible with residue-residue distance predictions**

ConKit is a Python library to provide a data object hierarchy and associated routine operations to
work and manipulate residue-residue contact prediction data. Main features shipped with this library
include:

- Parsers for Multiple Sequence Alignment, contact prediction and residue distance prediction files
- Analysis functions for Multiple Sequence Alignment, contact prediction data and residue distance prediction data
- Visualisation of Multiple Sequence Alignment, contact prediction data and residue distance prediction data
- Validation of models based on residue distance predictions
- Python wrappers for the contact-prediction-related software
